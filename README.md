ROSPlan Framework
=================

The main ROSPlan website and documentation is available here:
http://kcl-planning.github.io/ROSPlan/

The ROSPlan framework provides a generic method for task planning in a ROS system. ROSPlan encapsulates both planning and dispatch. It possesses a simple interface, and already includes interfaces to common ROS libraries.

### Installation

Get the prerequisites:

(for Indigo)
```sh
sudo apt-get install flex ros-indigo-mongodb-store ros-indigo-tf2-bullet freeglut3-dev
```
(for Hydro)
```sh
sudo apt-get install flex ros-hydro-mongodb-store ros-hydro-tf2-bullet freeglut3-dev
```
Select a catkin workspace or create a new one:
```sh
mkdir -p ROSPlan/src
cd ROSPlan/
```
Get the code:
```sh
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils
git clone https://github.com/KCL-Planning/rosplan
# optionally get the turtlebot interface
git clone https://github.com/KCL-Planning/rosplan_interface_turtlebot2
```
Compile everything:
```sh
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
catkin_make
```

### Running a demo with the turtlebot

The turtlebot demo is now a simple exploration mission. The turtlebot will visit randomly generated waypoints around a map.

The domain for this demo is in the `rosplan_demos` package, as `common/domain_turtlebot_demo.pddl`.

To run the demo first follow the installation instructions and quick-start guide for the Turtlebot Simulator and Gazebo:

[Turtlebot Gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo) 

[Turtlebot Simulator](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator) 

Then source the ROSPlan workspace in two terminals.

*1.* In the first terminal, begin the simulation, rviz visualisation, and ROSPlan nodes using the `turtlebot.launch` from the rosplan_demos package:
```
roslaunch rosplan_demos turtlebot.launch
```

*2.* In the second terminal run `turtlebot_explore.bash`, a script which
- adds to the knowledge base the PDDL objects and facts which comprise the initial state;
- adds the goals to the knowledge base; and
- calls the ROSPlan services which generate a plan and dispatch it.
```
rosrun rosplan_demos turtlebot_explore.bash
```

You should see the following output from the script:
```
waypoints: ['wp0', 'wp1', 'wp2', 'wp3', 'wp4', 'wp5']
Adding initial state and goals to knowledge base.
success: True
success: True
Calling problem generator.
Calling planner interface.
Calling plan parser.
Calling plan dispatcher.
Finished!
```

The turtlebot will move around the waypoints, exploring the environment. You should see output in the first terminal, something like:
```
...
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) Generating problem file.
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) The problem was generated.
KCL: (/rosplan_planner_interface) Problem received.
